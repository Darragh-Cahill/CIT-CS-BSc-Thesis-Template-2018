\section{Discussion}
The main problem I encountered during this is chapter two the research phase. Being given a project from McAfee a lot of the background information was already done and a lot of my research was talking to the development team and information gathering from the managers. Going forward having this style of interaction will be helpful as this is different to a lot of students but it was hard to put into words what was done. Communication is a big part of any project so I am grateful for this experience. 

Another problem is not having information on the data that will be going into our database. This just made it virtually impossible to plan our database in advance but once we're hands on working in McAfee this will become clear. 

\section{Conclusion}
Our problem is a simplistic one in a sense, many users that are being mishandled leading to a waste of time and resources. The solution is also simplistic to define. Centralize all users to a single application where an admin can control them and give support. Such a simplistic problem definition and solution has a rather complex implementation. The sheer amount of users and servers could lead to many problems. Servers could go down which our application will have no control over, our application speaking to other applications will be difficult and there is a lot of sensitive user data that has to be handled with care. Putting a lot of thought into our agile methodology is the pivotal point to make this project work. Having different environments for development, QA and production is what will make this work. 

\section{Future Work}
Given more time I would have implemented more diagrams to convey points better. Textual information is a good base to have but visual information helps wrap your head around things, while adding a nice aspect to the whole document.
